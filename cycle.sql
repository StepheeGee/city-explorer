/*
1. **Frontend Request:**
   - The user interacts with the City Explorer frontend application, initiating a request for information about a specific city (e.g., Atlanta) by clicking a button or entering a query.

2. **HTTP Request:**
   - The frontend (client-side) sends an HTTP request to the backend server, specifying the desired city information.
   - For instance, using `fetch` or `axios`, a GET request might be made to the backend API endpoint (`/explore?city=Atlanta`).

3. **Backend Processing:**
   - The backend (server-side) receives the HTTP request at the specified endpoint (`/explore`) along with the query parameter (`city=Atlanta`).
   - The server processes the request, accesses the information about the requested city from its data source (e.g., predefined data, external APIs, or databases).

4. **Data Retrieval:**
   - The backend fetches or retrieves the relevant data about the requested city (e.g., population, country, famous landmarks) based on the query parameters received.

5. **HTTP Response:**
   - The backend constructs an HTTP response containing the requested city information in a structured format, typically JSON.
   - This response is sent back to the frontend as the server's reply to the initial request.

6. **Frontend Handling Response:**
   - The frontend receives the HTTP response from the backend containing the information about the city (e.g., Atlanta's details).
   - The frontend code processes this response, often parsing the JSON data and using it to update the user interface, displaying the retrieved city information.

7. **User Interaction:**
   - The user interacts with the updated frontend interface, viewing the details about the city displayed on the screen.

This cycle repeats each time a user initiates a request for information about a different city or triggers any action that requires communication between the frontend and backend.

Throughout this process, the HTTP request-response cycle facilitates the exchange of data and communication between the frontend and backend, enabling the City Explorer application to provide city-related information to users.
